d4266a58-5314-45b7-9521-97a08e3fb3bd;Terrestrial Planets;These are rocky planets composed mainly of silicate rocks or metals, featuring solid surfaces.
6c94782e-4a13-4058-ad3b-f762e4e0b43b;Gas Giants;These large planets are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. They don't have a solid surface and are usually found far from their stars.
ee1a966d-a990-405c-8f43-6f7bbdf6f5ef;Ice Giants;Mostly frozen over,these planets tend to be found in the colder outer regions of star systems 
6fcb3dc0-bc89-4cdb-8b04-d59c93dea35c;Dwarf Planets;Smaller than regular planets, dwarf planets don't clear their orbits
c0b1349c-7292-4bbc-a6d1-84587b1affde;Super-Earths;These rocky planets are larger than Earth but smaller than gas giants. They’re some of the most common planets found outside our solar system.
ae0cc57c-f687-49a6-9a66-7641ffc8d6d1;Ocean Worlds;These planets are thought to be covered by vast oceans either on the surface or beneath an ice layer.
cae3326c-5175-4aaa-9041-a309d6cbe9df;Rogue Planets;These planets don’t orbit a star and wander through space alone, possibly after being ejected from their star systems due to gravitational interactions.
8ee4861f-995e-42b5-a891-e21d1957968b;Chthonian Planets;These are the remnants of gas giants whose atmospheres have been stripped away due to close proximity to their parent stars. What’s left is a dense rocky core, similar to a terrestrial planet. 
c32649b3-5ee1-4a26-8d3f-044d646d84f1;Lava Worlds;These planets have surfaces covered in molten lava due to extreme proximity to their stars. Their environments are hostile, with high temperatures making them unlikely to support life. 
dcc7db6f-73e1-4028-8292-20e4ac29c5a9;Others;The universe is a big place where many unique planet types exist.
